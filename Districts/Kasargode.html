                    impeccably maintained throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on
                    a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the
                    Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills
                    by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and
                    with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala.

                    two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque
                    built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A
                    rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself.

                    it easier to traverse the beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with

                    Mahabharata.) The temple is datable to seventeenth century and was built by the Ikkeri kings for
                    facilitating worship to the warriors brought from Karnataka. For a long time the temple was
                    completely neglected. In 1977, the site of the temple had to be shifted consequent on the
                    acquisition of temple lands for the railway line. Later the important structures were rebuilt by the
                    renovation committee. The compound wall was constructed in 1985

                    The Woody adventures Ranipuram provides Hadr and soft treks through this forest.
                    Evidence of pre-settlement traditions exist in the form of 'Theyyam', a folk dance to please the
                    mother goddess held in the month of May. This place was formerly known as Madathumala until the
                    1970s, when it was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Kottayam for the purpose of settlement.
                    Settlers renamed it as Ranipuram in memory of the virgin mother.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">There are two trekking routes available through the South Western Ghats moist
                    deciduous forests. Part of the way the climb is assisted by cut steps. The ambiance of the forest
                    trail is remarkable and once you reach the "Mani" (grass covered hilltop) the view is superb. The
                    undulating cloud-topped hills stretch up to the plains and ocean on the horizon. This is unexplored

                    Elephants pay visits in the summer months and leopards have been sighted in the not-too-distant
                    past. The Ranipuram forest should be declared as a wild life sanctuary by Kerala Forest Department
                    to merge with borders of Thalakavery wild life sanctuary in Karnataka. The proposed Ranipuram
                    Wildlife Sanctuary may protect and maintain overall biodiversity of the area in a better way. The
                    place holds immense potential for ecotourism and may develop into a premier hill station in Kerala
                    with the judicious development of amenities. Tourist cottages are available here provided by the
                    KTDC and some private players have entered the scene. The proposed Ranipuram Wildlife sanctuary will
                    be a boon to tourism development in Kasaragod district.</p>
