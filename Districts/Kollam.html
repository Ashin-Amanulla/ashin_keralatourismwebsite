                <p><span class="first-character sc">K</span>ollam (erstwhile Quilon) is a southern district of Kerala,
                    located 70 km north of the state’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. It is flanked by the Arabian sea on
                    the west, Tamil Nadu on the east, Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts on the north and
                    Thiruvananthapuram district on the south. Housing a population of over 2.6 million, Kollam is one of
                    the more densely peopled districts of India. The head quarters of the district administration is
                    centred at Kollam City, the district’s capital. Administratively, the district is composed of two
                    revenue divisions viz. Kollam and Punalur with three taluks each under them.

                    Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in
                    heat during April-May. The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy,
                    laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively.

                    The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water
                    body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists. This and the Kollam canal cutting
                    through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country. A number
                    of islands of varying sizes beautifully spot the vast expanse of the lake. The city is graced by
                    beaches where people go to spend quiet evenings. Kollam also has a considerably large forest cover
                    on its eastern side making home for several eco tourism projects like Shenduruni, Thenmala, Palaruvi
                    etc. </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Kollam City boasts of a long history of political, commercial and cultural
                    importance having found mention in several ancient travellers’ accounts. With a varied colonial past
                    under the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British, Kollam has locations of historical importance like
                    the Thangasseri light house, the St. Thomas Fort and cemetery built by the Portuguese, Thevally
                    Palace, Cheenakkottaram etc. Besides, it also is the site of several old buildings constructed by
                    the Travancore kings (its rulers during the pre-Independence times) in a variety of architectural
                    styles, where many government offices still function.

                    Kollam has been the centre of cashew industry in Kerala from the time of the Portuguese in 16th c.
                    Having hundreds of working cashew factories in the district, Kollam still continues to be the
                    largest processed cashew exporter in India. Neendakara and Thangasseri, the two fishing harbours and
                    ports in Kollam, support a thriving marine industry providing a variety of employment and livelihood
                    to people in large numbers.</p><br>

                    abducting her in his airborne chariot. Jatayu is said to have fought valiantly and fallen on these
                    rocks, grievously injured.

                    The Jatayu Adventure Center (Jatayu Earth's Center), at Chadayamangalam, 50 km from
                    Thiruvananthapuram, is a unique combination of artistry, mythology, technology, culture, adventure,
                    leisure, and wellness. The virtual reality museum and the theatrical magic that renders the story of
                    Jatayu add to the magic of the destination.

                    Kollam district, Ashtamudi Lake is also called the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala. About thirty
                    percent of the historic Kollam town is encompassed by the placid Ashtamudi Lake. Kollam has been
                    Kerala leading cities in the olden times. It was a leading trade capital of the old world from the
                    era of the Phoenicians and Ancient Rome.

                    The backwaters of Ashtamudi is acomplex labyrinth. It is the second largest and deepest wetland
                    ecosystem. The name ‘Ashtamudi’is adapted from the topography of the lake.‘Ashta’ means eight and
                    ‘mudi’ means coned. The beautiful lake gets its name Ashtamudi, because of its 8 arms or channels.

                <h2>THANGASSERY LIGHTHOUSE</h2>
            </div>

        <section>
            <div class="block">
                <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he small town of Thangassery is also famous for its beach,
                    aside from its historical significance. The beach is a 3km stretch of pristine white sands and
                    shallow waves that make it perfect for splashing and swimming. The backdrop of tall swaying coconut
                    trees makes for a relaxing backdrop to the serene, quiet beach. The 3km long breakwater along the
                    beach is a major attraction and a ride along it can improve on the enchantment quotient!

                    Another attraction to the beach is the famous Thangassery Lighthouse, which can be seen rising up
                    majestically above the coconut trees. The cylindrical lighthouse tower is painted in catchy red and
                    white oblique bands. You can bear witness to the glorious sun setting over the Arabian Sea, as well
                    as the rising moon as you drive down on the Lighthouse road. The Thangassery beach Lighthouse was
                    built in 1902 to guide fishermen and sailors along the reef-riddled coastal waters. Its beacon can
                    be seen up to 20km out at sea. History has it that prior to construction of the lighthouse, the
                    British East India Company had installed a tower with an oil lamp.

                    Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops.
                    This was later changed to keeping the fire on a raised platform to improve its visibility. It later
                    led to the development of the lighthouse. A lighthouse is a tower designed to emit light from a
                    system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a navigational aid for maritime piloting. The most famous
                    lighthouse structure was the Pharos of Alexandria; this, however, collapsed during an earthquake.
                    Due to the high cost of maintenance, the number of operational lighthouses has gone down drastically
                    and electronic navigational systems have taken over.</p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Still, the romance of the lighthouse makes it an added attraction as it now
                    beacons to the urbanites. Visitors are allowed to climb to the top of the 140feet high Thangassery
                    lighthouse tower during 10am to 5pm. The tiresome 200steps climb up the spiraling staircase to the
                    top of the tower is more than made up for by the spectacular 360 degrees panoramic view of the
                    Arabian Sea and splendor of the backwaters and Kollam city.

                    This lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse on the coast of Kerala and the splendid views from the
                    tower draw tourists like a magnet. The enchanting beauty and the calm silence of the secluded area
                    around the lighthouse are also great for a little family picnic, or just to spend some quality time
                    alone with only our thoughts to keep us company.

                    Kollam is easily accessible by train, road or air. Trivandrum International airport is barely 70km
                    away on brisk highways for those coming by flight. A cab ride can then get you to the Thangassery
                    beach and lighthouse from Kollam city. The city also offers accommodation ranging from budget to
                    luxury five-star hotels to suit all pockets. The Raviz, Ashtamudi is one such hotel where all your
                    needs can be met and your visit to the Thangassery lighthouse made even more memorable!</p>

                    include Lord Siva in the form of Siva Lingam, Hanuman and Nandikeswara. A Mandapam (roof) in front
                    of one of the rooms stands testimony to the skill of those who build this temple from a single piece
                    of rock. The temple premise also has a well that never dries up.
