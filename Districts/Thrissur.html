                    Thrissur is one of the most popular temples in Kerala. It is believed to be the first Shiva temple
                    built by Lord Parasurama who is the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. This temple is however one of
                    the UNESCO recognised heritage sites. The temple is also known as Thenkailasam or
                    Vrishabhachalam.The temple is built in typical Kerala style architecture, located on a hillock in
                    the heart of Thrissur city. Standing tall in the centre of 9 acres of land, the temple doesn't fail
                    to grab attention of the passers-by. There are 4 gateways called gopurams to the temple facing East,
                    West, North and South respectively.

                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">The temple is known for the rare murals portrayed here that include scenes from
                    Mahabharatha, of which Vasukishayana and Nrithanatha are worshipped daily. Apart from these murals,
                    the temple also houses a museum that showcases ancient paintings, woodcarving and other works of art
                    of ancient times.The Koothambalam of the temple, or the temple theatre, is rich in its display of
                    wooden carved vignettes. Koothambalam is used for staging ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala
                    like Koothu, Koodiyattam and Nangyar Koothu. The three main shrines in this temple are of Sri
                    Vadakkunnathan (Lord Shiva), Lord Shankaranarayana and Lord Rama. Goddess Parvati is also worshipped
                    here. One for the strange aspects of the temple is that the ghee offered here for centuries doesn't
                    melt, even in scorching summers. It is also believed that if the ghee covering the linga melts, that
                    would lead to a massive disaster.
