                <p><span class="first-character ny">T</span>wenty five kilometers away from Kalpetta lays two caves
                    which showcases nature’s skill and philosophy on architecture. These caves are located 1,200 m above
                    the sea level on Ambukutty Mala. The name ‘Edakkal’ literally means ‘a stone in between’. Here you
                    can see a cave formed by a heavy boulder straddling a fissure in the rock.

                    Many legends are there behind the formation of Edakkal caves. One of the stories is that, these
                    caves are said to be formed with the arrows fired by Lava and Kusha, the sons of Lord Sri Rama.
                    Another one is associated with Kutti Chathan and the Goddess Mudiampilly. The local people used to
                    have a pilgrimage trip to this place to honour the Goddess.

                    Edakkal cavesThe caves were discovered by Fred Fawcett, the then Superintendent of Police of the
                    Malabar district in 1890, during his hunting trip to Wayanad. He discovered the Edakkal
                    rock-shelter, situated on the western side of Edakkalmala. To his surprise, he identified the place
                    as a habitat of Neolothic people.
                </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Edakkal caves are famous for its pictorial paintings (cave paintings), which
                    are considered to be of 6000 B C. To reach the caves, one has to trek through the Ambukutty Mala. It
                    will take around 45 minutes to climb the hill and you will never get disappointed in your trip to
                    these historic caves.

                    high and the upper chamber is 96 ft long, 22 ft wide and 18 ft high. You can sight carvings of
                    human, animal figures and objects used by humans, on the walls of the caves. These carvings give
                    great evidence for a highly civilized society who lived in the pre-historic age. Edakkal caves have
                    drawn great attention of archeologists and historians worldwide.

                    Edakkal cavesEdakkal is the only known place in India with Stone Age carvings. You can see here
                    carvings belonging to Neolithic and Mesolithic age. The human figures of these caves have raised
                    hair and some have masks. They all have archeological significance and are interesting too. Along
                    with these pictorial carvings, you can also watch Tamil and Brahmi Script in Edakkal caves.

                    Edakkal is said to have some links with Indus Valley Civilization too. Around 400 signs were
                    discovered recently, which had shown its relationship with the ancient civilization. The prominent
                    among them was ‘a man with a jar cup’. </p>
