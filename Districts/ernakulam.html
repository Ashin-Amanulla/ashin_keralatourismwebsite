                <p><span class="first-character sc">E</span>rnakulam or Cochin/Kochi is a modern city where shopping
                    markets, cinema complexes,industrial buildings, amusement parks,marine drive, etc are located.It is
                    also the commercial and IT hub of Kerala. From time immemorial, Arabs, Chinese, Dutch, British and
                    Portuguese sea-farers followed the sea route to Kochi and left their impressions on the town. The
                    Chinese fishing nets swaying in the breeze over the backwaters, the Jewish Synagogue, the Dutch
                    Palace , the Bolghatty Palace and Portuguese architecture in Kochi enrich the heritage of Kerala.

                    Initially, Kochi was an obscure fishing village that later on became the first European township in
                    India. The town was shaped by the Portuguese, the Dutch and later the British. The result of these
                    cultural influences are seen in the many examples of Indo European architecture that still exist
                    here. Some of the well known tourist attractions in Kochi are the Chinese fishing nets,Vasco
                    House,Parade grounds, Cochin club,Jew town,Cherai beach, etc. </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">The district is endowed with a rich flora and fauna spread over the mainland
                    and the hinterlands. Two backwaters and three major rivers have been instrumental in the
                    agricultural, industrial and trade development of Ernakulam. Although the construction of huge
                    overbridges such as the Goshree and Varapuzha in recent years have reduced the importance of
                    water-transportation it is still a great attraction for the domestic and international tourists.
                    Monsoon has not been unkind to Ernakulam District all these years. Mangrove forests here come to
                    around 465 square KMs. The foothill areas such as Kodanad and Kothamangalam have a relatively stable
                    eco-system. Besides paddy and coconuts, cash crops too are produced in the district. Ernakulam is
                    the biggest pineapple producing district in Kerala. Two bird sanctuaries in the district, Thattekkad
                    and Mangalavanam, are shelter to the endangered species of birds and primordial spiders.</p>

            <div class="block">
                <p><span class="first-character ny">S</span>et foot into Fort Kochi and you will be instantly
                    transported to a different time period. This place is steeped in the history and culture of all who
                    have occupied it through the ages. Its roots and essence are unique in its diversity.

                    While walking through K. J. Herschel Road, one gets a glimpse of Fort Immanuel. This former
                    Portuguese bastion, built in 1503, is a sign of the strategic alliance between the Maharaja of
                    Cochin and the Portuguese Monarch. Further along the road one can see the Dutch Cemetery, housing
                    the graves of former Colonists. People also love visiting the nearby Thakur House, a bungalow built
                    in typical colonial era style. It now belongs to Thakur and Co., a renowned tea trading firm, but
                    was once the residence of the officers of the National Bank of India during British rule. It was
                    formerly called Kunal or Hill Bungalow.

                    Another delightful location is David Hall, named after David Koder who was a famous occupant of the
                    hall. However it is more closely associated with the Dutch Commander Hendrik Adriaan van Reed tot
                    Drakeston. He is famous for his book on the flora of Kerala, ‘Hortus Malabaricus’. One can also
                    visit St. Francis Church, the oldest European church in India. Built in 1503, it was here that the
                    legendary explorer Vasco-da-Gama was originally buried. The Vasco-da-Gama Square is a beautiful
                    promenade nearby where one can go for a relaxing walk. One can drop by Pierce Leslie Bungalow to
                    view the waterfront verandas or Koder House, a fine example of the transition from colonial to
                    Indo-European architecture.
                </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Vasco House is another must visit landmark as it is said to have been the
                    explorer’s actual residence. It is among the oldest Portuguese buildings in Kochi. A visit to the
                    legendary Bishop House is an enriching experience. The facade of the house has large Gothic arches
                    and the building was acquired by Dom Jos Gomes Ferreira, the 27th Bishop of the Diocese of Cochin.

                    The streets, shops and the residents operate at their own pace. Time is rather abstract in Fort
                    Kochi, and visitors will feel instantly transported into another era altogether. </p>

                    Mulavukadu and Vallarpadam and then end at Marine Drive, Kochi. The island also named as Vypeen is a
                    fast-developing suburb of the city. It was formed in the year 1341 after a heavy flood.

                    avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and ought to be turned into a
