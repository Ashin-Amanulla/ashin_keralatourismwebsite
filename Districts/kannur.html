                <p><span class="first-character sc">K</span>annur is one among the northernmost districts in the south
                    western state of Kerala in India. The old name 'Cannanore' is the anglicised form of the Malayalam
                    word Kannur. Kannur might have derived its name from one of the the Hindu diety, Kannan (Lord
                    Krishna) and Ur (place) making it the place of Lord Krishna. The deity of the Katalayi Sreekrishna
                    temple was earlier situated in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern part of the Kannur
                    town.

                    With the Western Ghats in the east and lakshadweep sea in the west, kannur district is bounded by a
                    wealth of natural beauty. Kannur is blessed with natural beaches, hill stations, rivers, backwaters,
                    historical monuments and religious centres. The district itself which shares much of the natural
                    splendour has been a key contributor to the cultural, religious, political and industrial heritage
                    of the state. In addition, Kannur enjoys the credit of having been the cradle of many a colourful
                    folk art and folk music of Kerala.

                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Kannur is rightly described as “The land of Looms and Lores”. Kannur is well
                    known for its handlooms. It is one of the major exporter handlooms in India. The handloom cloths of
                    Kannur have won international reputation. The industry was confined to the production of coarse
                    varieties of dhoties and like, in the past. Production of quality and exportable varieties of
                    handloom fabric was started when the Basal Evengelical Mission entered the field. The handloom
                    industry, which was once the monopoly of private enterprise, has since been organised on
                    co-operative lines. It provides employment to hundreds of thousands of people directly and
                    indirectly.

                    Kannur is rich in traditional art and culture. Kannur is the home of Kerala folklore academy. The
                    gift of Kannur in the field of art and culture is its folk arts. A large number of folk plays and
                    dances are prevalent among the scheduled caster and tribes. Each tribe has its own glorious
                    collection of folk plays and dances which are performed during festivals. Theyyam or Theyattam is an
                    ancient and still popular ritual dance. It’s a unique combination of dance, music and also reflects
                    the main features of a tribal culture. Theyyam is generally performed in front of the village
                    shrines. There are a large number of temples in Kannur where Theyyam is performed.</p>

                <p><span class="first-character ny">C</span>onsidered as one of the most historic sites in Kannur, the
                    St. Angelo Fort was constructed by the first Portuguese viceroy of India. The fort is triangular in
                    shape appears as a massive yet magnificent structure standing at the helm of the ruthless sea.St.
                    Angelo’s Fort (also known as Kannur Fort or Kannur Kotta), is a fort facing the Arabian Sea,
                    situated 3 km from the town of Kannur.

                    St. Angelo's Fort was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of
                    India and is on the Arabian sea about 3 km from Kannur town. It was attacked in vain by the local
                    Indian ruler in the Siege of Cannanore (1507).

                    On August 1509 Almeida, refusing to recognize Afonso de Albuquerque's as the new portuguese governor
                    to supersede himself, arrested him in this fortress after having fought the naval Battle of Diu.
                    Afonso de Albuquerque was released after three months' confinement, and become governor on the
                    arrival of the grand-marshal of Portugal with a large fleet, in October 1509.

                    The fort changed hands several times. In 1663 the Dutch captured it and sold it to the Arakkal Royal
                    Family in 1772. The British conquered it in 1790 and transformed it into one of their major military
                    stations on the Malabar Coast.
                    It is fairly well preserved as a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. A
                    painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind it can be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

                <p class="margin-top-10">The laterite walls made of stone lend it an even more imposing air and it is a
                    must-visit destination for architecture students. The sea wall segregating the fort from the sea
                    provides breathtaking views of the Mopilla Bay. Visit the fort for taking a relaxing walk in the
                    complex and enjoy stunning views of the Arabian Sea. The fort is in Cannanore cantonment area. St
                    Angelo's fort is a most important historical monument and a good tourist centre. Here Kerala Police
                    have posted 6 Tourism Policemen for the protection and guidance to the tourists. Among them one
                    Policeman Sathyan Edakkad has detailed knowledge about this fort and the surrounding places. He
                    wrote and published a book in Malayalam language named Vasco da Gamayum Charitrathile
                    Kaanapurangalum (Vasco da Gama and the unseen pages of history). In this book, he describes the past
                    and present situation of the fort.

                    The Moppila Bay Harbor and Arakkal Mosque are near the fort. The fort is now renovated and
                    well-maintained under the supervision of the Archaeological Survey of India. Tourists are allowed
                    entry to the fort every day of the week between 8 AM to 6 PM. </p>

                    family, the only Muslim royal family in Kerala, south India. The museum is actually a section of the
                    Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Palace). The durbar hall section of the palace has been converted into a
                    museum by the Government of Kerala.

                    Arakkal family is the royal family which ruled Kannur for several centuaries. They had family
                    relationship with Kolathiris, the rulers of the neighbouring Chirakkal kingdom. Arakkal family had
                    trade relationship with Arabs and later with Europeans. The islands of Lakshadweep and Maldives were
                    ruled by Arakkal family. The king of Arakkal kingdom was known as Arakkal Raja and the Queen was
                    known as Arakkal Beevi.

                    the Archaeological Survey of India. The government had taken a keen interest in preserving the
                    heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a prominent role in the history of Malabar. A
                    nominal entry fee is charged by the Arakkal Family Trust from visitors to the museum.

                    Thalaserry Fort, as a testimonial to their colonial imperialism. In 1700, the British built the
                    Thalassery Fort on a small hill called Tiruvellapadkunnu and in 1708, it was strengthened by
                    increasing its height and with bastions.

                    The fort is a square structure built of laterite and is distinguished by its massive ventilated
                    walls and strong flanking bastions. The fort has secret tunnels to the sea and intricately carved
                    huge doors. It was here that Haider's captain was imprisoned. </p>
