                    has been ranked the second best city in India to reside in. Also known as Calicut, this beautiful
                    city boasts of beautiful beaches, parks, temples, churches, sanctuaries, hillocks, museums,
                    wildlife, sculptures, rivers and lots more. It is the prominent trade and commerce center in Kerala.
                    Vasco Da Gama first set foot here in 1498 after which it became one of the most important ports in
                    the Malabar region for the trade of spices, silk and other goods between European countries and
                    India. The nature of land in Kozhikode is marshy. That is the reason why the world also knows
                    Kozhikode as Chullikkad, which means a ‘shrubby jungle’. The friendly nature of the people of
                    Kozhikode, along with their love for traditional values is heart touching.

                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Erstwhile Malabar District of British India became a part of the newly formed
                    Kerala on November 1 1956 and a new revenue district named Kozhikode was formed on January 1, 1957.
                    Kozhikode is known to the world as the Center of Malabar, the land of spices and festivals. It
                    attracts traders from all over the globe with its magnificent spices and other commodities.
                    Kozhikode attained a position of pre-eminence in the trade of pepper and other spices since 13th
                    century which made it an ‘Indian Emporium’ of International trade. From time immemorial, the city
                    has been attracting travelers. Its charming physical features and the prosperity is what makes it
                    stand out way above any other city.

                    The economy of Kozhikode mainly depends on agriculture and fisheries but it is not just limited to
                    them. The timber industry is very powerful in Kozhikode and it is also the main center for the
                    export of tea, coffee and coconuts..</p>
