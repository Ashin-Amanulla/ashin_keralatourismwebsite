                <p><span class="first-character atw">K</span> erala has had a long association with teak and has always
                    played a central role in its cultivation and trade. The word teak itself is said to have come from
                    the Malayalam word 'theku'. The Teak Museum in Nilambur celebrates this ancient relationship and
                    takes one on a special journey through history, chronicling teak and its importance in our culture.

                    Teak is still the most sought after form of timber. The museum was made of the sub-centre of Kerala
                    Forest Research Institute (KFRI) in 1995. Teak is extremely significant in the area. The world's
                    first Teak (Tectonagrandis) plantation was raised in Nilambur way back in the 1840s and is among the
                    premier teak plantations in the world. Visitors come here in large numbers and are greeted by the
                    extensive root system of a 55-year-old teak tree in the portico.

                    The ground floor of the facility is dedicated to research on the Kannimara Teak. The teak plantation
                    nearby is host to this great tree which is the oldest of its kind in the world. It is an integral
                    part of the region’s history and we get a detailed account of the bark, flower and fruit of the
                    teak. We alsocatch a glimpse into the teak plantation activities undertaken 160 years ago. Some of
                    the other attractions here are the traditional granary and a miniature model of a sailing vessel
                    called Uru, made of teak wood.

                </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">Here, one can also find the large stump of a 480-year-old teak tree brought
                    from Nagarampara Forest Range in Kottayam division. You can also observe the various methods of
                    seed-grading, pre-sowing treatment, preparation of teak stumps, vegetative propagation of teak and
                    the different stages in the complete rotation cycle of teak from seed to mature tree.

                    There are a variety of birds and reptiles in the 800 m long bio-resources natural trail. There are
                    50 naturally grown tree species and 136 endangered and near-extinct tree species of the Western
                    Ghats planted here. About 58 species of birds, both resident and migratory, has been recorded in
                    this area. This museum takes you on an enriching journey that cannot be replicated anywhere else in
                    the world.

                    fascinate you with its perennial springs, waterfalls and sheer charm. Walk through the lush green
                    valleys and feel refreshed and young all again.

                    Nestling amidst the mist-clad Amminikkadan hills in Malappuram district, Kodikuthimala is a favoured
                    weekend destination in north Kerala. Popularly known as the mini Ooty of Malappuram, this green
                    paradise has long been a magnet for trekkers, travel junkies and nature enthusiasts. It is the best
                    place to stop by on your trip to north Kerala.

                    You are sure to feel truly rejuvenated as you step into this quaintly beauteous atmosphere. The
                    grassy meadows, the cool breeze and the serene, secluded ambience are truly rewarding. You will get
                    a chance to see a spectrum of vibrant flora and fauna as well.

                    It is believed that the British hoisted (kuthi) their flag (kodi) on this hill (mala), during a
                    survey, and thus the place came to be known as Kodikuthimala (literally, the hill where a flag was
                    hoisted). </p>
                <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
                <p class="margin-top-10">The place is situated at an altitude of 2,000 feet above sea level, offering a
                    spectacular visual treat. It also has a watch tower that offers its visitors a vantage point to
                    seize a panoramic view and distil the full essence of its splendour.

                    As you trek up and down the undulating landscape of Kodikuthimala you are likely to see Nature in
                    all her moods. You may be enveloped by a blanket of mist or baptized by a light drizzle, you may be
                    caressed by happy sunshine or pricked by a bit of chill. At times when the mist becomes palpably
                    thick, the hilltop can get quite spooky too!

                    Come to Kodikuthimala and soak yourself in its scintillating sights!
