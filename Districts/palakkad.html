                    tree” (Alsteria Scholaris) and “kadu” (forest). Palakkad, due to its geographical position, has a
                    strategic role in Kerala. Before the commissioning of Konkan Railway along the Western coast,
                    Palakkad was the gateway to Kerala from the country.The 32 to 40 km gap in the 960km Western Ghats
                    functions as an inlet for northeast monsoon and dry winds. N H 47, a major artillery of Kerala,
                    passes through this Ghat section.The whole area is said to have been once covered by pala trees.

                    cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height of
                    the hills ranges from approximately 467 m to 1572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all
                    who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to
                    the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to
                    Nelliyampathy.

                    The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic
                    place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints
                    from where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields
                    forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a
                    geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view, parts of
                    the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu.

                    On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close look at the privately managed farms
                    and also vast expanses of tea estates managed by different plantation companies. The hills of
                    Nelliyampathy are also well known for its orange cultivation.

                <p class="margin-top-10">Privately owned hotels and resorts are located at various points, as one goes
                    up the hills of Nelliyampathy. The bio-farms located here are a major landmark as one proceeds up
                    before reaching the topmost point at Palagapandi Estate. The estate has a quaint bungalow, built
                    during the British rule in India, and has now been converted into a private owned resort. At
                    Kaikatty, a community hall is available, which is usually used as a base by those interested in
                    trekking.

                    Not far away from Palagapandy is Seetharkundu where one can have a fantastic view of the valley and
                    a 100 m high waterfall providing an added attraction. From Palagapandy, one can trek or go by jeep
                    to reach Mampara; another breathtaking vantage point at Nelliyampathy. The area in and around
                    Palagapandy Estate has tea, cardamom and coffee plantations with adjoining hills allowing one to
                    catch a glimpse of the wildlife in the form of Indian Gaur, elephants, leopards, Giant Squirrel etc.
